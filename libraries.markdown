###Keras
```
Keras is a high-level API to build and train deep learning models. It's used for fast prototyping, advanced research, and production, with three key advantages:
```
######User friendly
Keras has a simple, consistent interface optimized for common use cases. It provides clear and actionable feedback for user errors.
######Modular and composable
Keras models are made by connecting configurable building blocks together, with few restrictions.
######Easy to extend
Write custom building blocks to express new ideas for research. Create new layers, loss functions, and develop state-of-the-art models.

###Tesseract

```text
Tesseract is an open source text recognizer (OCR) Engine, available under the Apache 2.0 license. It can be used directly, or (for programmers) using an API to extract printed text from images. It supports a wide variety of languages.

Tesseract doesn't have a built-in GUI, but there are several available from the 3rdParty page.
